Hi all, this is a librarian application. When you run the .py file, a menu will pop up. You can perform actions such as listing all books, adding a new book, searching by ISBN or name, checking out books, and more. The application uses books.txt for book information and students.txt for student data.

```python
1- List all books.
2- List checked out books.
3- Add a new book.
4- Search book by ISBN number.
5- Search a book by name.
6- Checkout a book.
7- List all students.
8- List top 3 books.
9- List top 3 students.
10- Exit.
```
## Install and Run
It's quite easy to use this application. All you have to do is:
```Python
python3 library_management.py
```
and you'll encounter a menu.
